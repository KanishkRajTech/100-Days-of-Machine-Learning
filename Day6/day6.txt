📘 Day 6: Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning
👉 Instance-based learning memorizes data.
👉 Model-based learning generalizes from data.


1️⃣ Instance-Based Learning (Memory-Based)
🔹 What it is
    Stores training data
    Makes predictions by comparing new data with stored instances
    No explicit model is built
    📌 Learning happens at prediction time

🔸 How it works (intuition)
    Store all data
    New data comes
    Find similar data points
    Decide based on similarity

🔹 Pros & Cons
    Pros
        Simple to understand
        No training time
        Adapts easily
    Cons
        Slow predictions
        High memory usage
        Sensitive to noise



2️⃣ Model-Based Learning
🔹 What it is
    Learns a mathematical model
    Extracts patterns from data
    Discards raw data after learning
    📌 Learning happens during training

🔸 How it works (intuition)
    Choose a model
    Train on data
    Learn parameters
    Use model for predictions

🔹 Example Algorithms
    Linear Regression
    Logistic Regression
    Decision Trees
    Neural Networks

🔹 Pros & Cons
    Pros
        Fast predictions
        Uses less memory
        Better for large datasets
    Cons
        Training can be slow
        Needs careful tuning
        Harder to understand sometimes
