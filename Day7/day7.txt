📘 Day 7: Challenges in ML 
👉 Machine Learning faces various challenges that impact its effectiveness and reliability.
1️⃣ Data Collection
    It is either from APIs, web scraping, or sensors.
    ->Data is hard to collect 
Challenges:
    -Getting enough data
    -Accessing data from reliable sources
Note: Grabage in, garbage out
2️⃣ Insufficient Data
    When the data set is too small to learn meaningful patterns.
Challenges:
    -Poor model performance
    -ML need large datasets
    -Labeling data is expensive

3️⃣ Non-Representative Data
    When the training data does not reflect the real-world data, the model may fail to generalize.
    Example: Training an face detection model only on adult faces but useing it on children faces.


4️⃣ Poor Quality Data
    -noise
    -missing values
    -incorrect labels
    -duplicates

5️⃣ Irreleveant Features
    Including features (columns) that do not help the model

6️⃣ Overfitting
    When a model learns the training data too well, including its noise.
    - performance proof on new data
    - Looks great in trainging, fails in testing

7️⃣ Underfitting
    When a model is too simple and fails to capture patterns in the data.
    - performance poorly on both training and testing data

8️⃣ Software Integration
    Getting your ML model to work within real applications or systems(APIs, web apps, mobile apps)
Challenges:
    -APIs deployment
    -Model serving
    -Latency and scalling

9️⃣ Offline Learning/deployment
    Model are ofter trained offline and deployed to production.
Challenges: 
    -Model may become outdated over time and need retraining
