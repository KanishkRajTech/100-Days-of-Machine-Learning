Day 11 Tensors
👉 A Tensors is a generalized data structure used to store data in multiple dimensions.

Types of Tensors:
- Scalar: A single value (0D tensor)
    -> It has zero dimensions.
    -> single value like 5, -3.2, or 0.0
    e.g., import numpy as np
          arr = np.array(7)
          print(arr.ndim)  # Output: 0

- Vector: A one-dimensional array of values (1D tensor)
    -> It has one dimension.
    -> a list of values like [1, 2, 3]
    no. of axis = rank = number of dimensions
    note:-
          [1 3 2 4] -> 1D tensor (vector)
            4 elements hai so 3D vector


- Matrix: A two-dimensional array of values (2D tensor)
    -> It has two dimensions.
   
- 3D Tensors: stck of matrices (3D tensor)
    -> It has three dimensions.
    e.g., A color image represented as height x width x color channels (RGB)
      (Heinght X Width X channels)

- Higher-Rank Tensors (4D, 5D, etc.):-
    used:- videos, Batch of images, NLP sequences
- Batch of images: (batch_size, height, width, channels) -> 4D tensor
- Videos: (batch_size, frames, height, width, channels) -> 5D tensor


Rank, axis, Shape and size of Tensors:
    no of dimensions = rank/ndim = no of axis

    shape =>(2X3) Matrix
                   (2,3) -> shape of matrix

    size => (2X3) matrix
                total elements = 6
