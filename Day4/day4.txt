🧱 Batch Machine Learning (Offline Learning)
    Batch learning learns from all data at once.

🔹 What it is
    Model is trained on entire dataset at once
    Training happens offline
    Model is deployed after training
    📌 No learning after deployment (unless retrained)

🔸 How it works
    Collect data
    Train model
    Deploy model
    Stop learning ❌
    Retrain later (if needed)

🔹 Pros & Cons
    Pros
        Simple to implement
        Stable model
        High accuracy on static data
    Cons
        Cannot adapt to new data instantly
        Retraining is costly (time & compute)
