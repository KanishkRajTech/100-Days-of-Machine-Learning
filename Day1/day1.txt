What is Machine Learning?

👉 Simple definition
Machine Learning (ML) is a way to make computers learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed for every rule.
    If a computer improves its performance by experience (data), that’s Machine Learning.

🆚 Programming vs Machine Learning
Traditional Programming
    Rules + Data → Output
    Example:
        Rules: if marks > 40 → pass
        Data: student marks
        Output: pass/fail
Machine Learning
    Data + Output → Rules (Model)
    Example:
        Data: past student marks
        Output: pass/fail
        ML figures out the rule itself
