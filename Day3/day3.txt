📘 Types of Machine Learning
    Supervised Learning
    Unsupervised Learning
    Semiexpresed Learning
    Reinforcement Learning

1️⃣ Supervised Learning
    A type of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled data (input-output pairs) to find patterns
        Data is labeled
        Model learns from input → correct output

    Types of Supervised Learning
    🅰️ Regression
        Used when output is a number (continuous value)
    🅱️ Classification
        Used when output is a category (label)

2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning
    A type of machine learning where algorithms learn patterns and structures from unlabeled data
        No labels
        Model finds hidden patterns by itself

    Types of Unsupervised Learning
    🅰️ Clustering
        Group similar data points
    🅱️Dimensionality Reduction
        Reduce features while keeping important information
    🅲️ Association
        Find relationships between items

3️⃣ Semi-Supervised Machine Learning
    Semi-Supervised Learning uses:
        A small amount of labeled data
        A large amount of unlabeled data

4 Reinforcement Learning
    Learning by trial and error
    Uses reward and punishment
    Types of Reinforcement Learning
    🅰️ Positive Reinforcement
        Reward for correct action
    🅱️ Negative Reinforcement
        Penalty for wrong action
