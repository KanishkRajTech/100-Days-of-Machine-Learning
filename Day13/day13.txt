Day 13: End to End project

👉 End to End ML Project Steps
steps 0: Preprocess + EDA + Feature Selection
steps 1: Extract input and Output cols
steps 2: Scale the value
steps 3: Train Test Split
steps 4: Train the model
steps 5: Evaluate the model
steps 6: Deploy the model

placemnet.csv
   nunnamed:0  cgpa  iq  placemnet
0          0  7.5 120        1
1          1  8.0 130        1  
2          2  6.5 115        0
3          3  9.0 140        1
4          4  5.5 110        0

0) For Preprocess:-
    we have to remove some column in the data because 1 to 100 and 1 to 100 is two times.

    df.iloc[:,1:]-> give the data anward 1st column.

0) Extract Input and Output cols:-
    Here we from graph and visualization the data, we can use seaborn pairplot.

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.scatter(df['cgpa'],df['iq'],c=df['placemnet'])

0) Feature Selection:-
    From the above data visual, we can decide which algo will work Here,Linear regression will work because Dataset is easily separable into two parts.

1) Extract Input and Output cols:-
    X = df.iloc[:,0:2] -> get index cgpa and iq
    y = df.iloc[:,-1] -> get last column placemnet

3) Train Test Split:-
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.1)

   0.1 -> 10% data for testing and 90% data for training
   i.e out of 100 rows, 90 rows for training and 10 rows for testing

2) For Scaling the value:-
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   scaler = StandardScaler()
   X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
   X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

4) Train the model:-
    We have decided to use Logistic Regression classifier because output is 0 and 1

    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    clf = LogisticRegression()
    clf.fit(X_train,y_train)

5) Evaluate the model:- working on test data
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    for accuracy calculation:-
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)

    O/P 0.9 or 90% i.e 10 input diya toh ye aapko 10 main se 9 sahi predict karke de raha hai aur ek galat predict kar raha hai.

    If you want to get decision_boundary i.e want to get how regression line is drawn

    form mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions
    plot_decision_regions(X_train, y_train.values, clf=clf, legend=2
